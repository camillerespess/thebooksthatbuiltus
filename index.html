  <p><span>I can credit Junie B. Jones</span> for my fierce sense of independence. She probably contributed to my sometimes-too-sassy personality of the first and second grade, too. Junie knows what she wants. She is  intelligent and confident. Junie also has a soft side to her, even if she is hard pressed to admit it. Because of Camila from “A Bad Case of Stripes,” I was terrified of lima beans. But my 7-year-old sense of curiosity made me want to eat them anyway, even if it meant I’d turn rainbow-colored. After all, I did ask my mother to paint me in colored stripes like Camila for Halloween. She did not oblige.</p>
  <p> I have a silly sense of adventure and an inclination for spontaneity. The "Magic Tree House" series deserves some credit for that, too. These books could once be found sprawled around my garden-themed room, the floor of my mom’s car and cradled in my arms after I fell asleep with my orange floral reading lamp still on. These are some of the books that built me. I want to know the books that shaped you, too.</p>
